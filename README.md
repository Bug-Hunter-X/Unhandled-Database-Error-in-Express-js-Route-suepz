This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers. The `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches user data from a database but lacks proper error handling.  When a database error occurs, the error is logged to the console, but the client receives a generic 500 error. This is bad for user experience and debugging.  `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling, which provides more informative error messages to the client and more details for debugging.
